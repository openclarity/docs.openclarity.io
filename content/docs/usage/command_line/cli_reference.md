This section provides a sample configuration for scanner families supported by
the OpenClarity CLI tool. Each family can be enabled or disabled, and configured
with specific options. The configuration is used to define which scanners to
run, what inputs to scan, and the configuration for each scanner.

```yaml
{{% external-file %}}
```
