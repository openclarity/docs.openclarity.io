1. From the navigation bar on the left, select **Runtime Scan**.
1. Click **Schedule Scan**.

1. (Optional) If you have already configured [CIS benchmarks]({{< relref "/docs/archive/kubeclarity/runtime-scans/cis-benchmark/_index.md" >}}), you can select **CIS Docker Benchmark** to enable them for the scheduled scan.

1. Set the type of the scan.

    - **Later**: Run the scan once at the specified time.
    - **Repetitive**: A recurring scan that runs periodically.

1. Set the time of the scan, then click **SAVE**.

    - For a one-time scan, set the date and time when it should run.
    - For a repetitive scan, set its frequency.
        <!-- FIXME when will it run first? -->
