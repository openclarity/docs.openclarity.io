## Announcement: OpenClarity Unification

We have reached the final step in the OpenClarity unification roadmap. Previously, we successfully enriched VMClarity with Kubernetes scanning and runtime features, achieving feature parity with KubeClarity.

We are currently in the process of unifying the two projects - [KubeClarity](https://github.com/openclarity/kubeclarity) and [VMClarity](https://github.com/openclarity/vmclarity) - into one consolidated project under [OpenClarity](https://github.com/openclarity/openclarity).

The VMClarity and KubeClarity repositories will not be maintained in the future. Thank you for your support and contributions as we continue to enhance and streamline the OpenClarity ecosystem.
