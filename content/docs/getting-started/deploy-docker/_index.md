## Prerequisites

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Deployment steps

To run OpenClarity in Docker on a local machine, complete the following steps.

1. Download the latest OpenClarity release.

    ```shell
    wget https://github.com/openclarity/openclarity/releases/download/v{{< param "latest_version" >}}/docker-compose-v{{< param "latest_version" >}}.tar.gz
    ```

1. Create a new directory, extract the files and navigate to the directory.

    ```shell
    mkdir docker-compose-v{{< param "latest_version" >}}
    tar -xvzf docker-compose-v{{< param "latest_version" >}}.tar.gz -C docker-compose-v{{< param "latest_version" >}}
    cd docker-compose-v{{< param "latest_version" >}}
    ```

1. Start every control plane element with the docker compose file.

    ```shell
    docker compose --project-name openclarity --file docker-compose.yml up -d --wait --remove-orphans
    ```

    The output should be similar to:

    ```

    Please note that the `image_override.env` file enables you to use the images you build yourself. You can override parameters in the `docker-compose.yml` by passing a custom env file to the `docker compose up` command via the `--env-file` flag. The `/installation/docker/image_override.env` file contains an example overriding all the container images.

1. Check the running containers in the Docker desktop.

## Clean up steps

1. After you've finished your tasks, stop the running containers.

    ```shell
    docker compose --project-name openclarity --file docker-compose.yml down --remove-orphans
    ```
