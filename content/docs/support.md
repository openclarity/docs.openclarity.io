## Community Support

If you encounter problems while using OpenClarity that the documentation does not address, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/openclarity/) in the repository of the relevant component or talk to us on [Slack](https://outshift.slack.com/messages/vmclarity).

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already reported or fixed by searching through our issue tracker.

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and, if possible, a test case.

If you discover a security bug, please do not report it through GitHub issues. Instead, please follow the steps in Security procedures.
